### Simple Example of FT Application
##### Imagine you have a complex sound wave, like a chord played on a piano. The FT can help you identify the different notes (frequencies) that make up that chord. Similarly, in an image, FT can help you identify patterns and features that are not easily visible in the spatial domain.

##### Overall, the Fourier Transform provides a way to understand and manipulate signals and data by transforming them from the time (or spatial) domain to the frequency domain.
